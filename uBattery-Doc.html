        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>uBattery is a real-time battery monitoring tool designed to provide key insights into your device’s battery performance. It features a dynamic graph that displays battery levels from 0% to 100% and offers comprehensive information about your battery’s capacity, charge and discharge rates, full charge capacity, usage time, and overall status.</p>

            <div class="list-item">
                <b>B. [Charge Rate]</b> - ChargeRate indicates the rate at which the battery receives electrical energy when charged. Usually measured in units of mW (milliwatt).<br>
                <div class="sub-list">
                    <p><b>Ex.</b> Positive Value: Indicates that energy is being input into the battery (battery is charging).</p>
                    <p>Zero Value: Indicates that no charging is occurring.</p>
                    <p>Negative Value (rare): May indicate an error or reverse charging (abnormal).</p>
                </div>
                <p><b>Factors Affecting ChargeRate:</b></p>
                <div class="sub-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Charger Capacity: The greater the charger output power (e.g., 18W vs. 5W), the higher the ChargeRate.</li>
                        <li>Battery Condition: Old or damaged batteries may charge more slowly.</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Charging may slow down if the battery is too hot.</li>
                        <li>Charging Rate: ChargeRate is usually higher when battery capacity is low, and slows down when approaching 100% to protect the battery.</li>
                        <li>Quick Charge Technology: Enables higher ChargeRate by using specific protocols (e.g., QC, PD, VOOC).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p><b>Example Values:</b> 500 mW: The battery is being charged with 500 milliwatts of power.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="list-item">
                <b>C. [Discharge Rate]</b> - DischargeRate indicates the speed at which the battery releases energy for use by the device. This is usually measured in mW (milliwatt).<br>
                <div class="sub-list">
                    <p><b>Ex.</b> Positive Value: Indicates that energy is being removed from the battery (normal during use).</p>
                    <p>Zero Value: Indicates that no energy is being released (for example, the device is connected to external power).</p>
                    <p>Negative Value (rare): Indicates an error in the calculation.</p>
                </div>
                <p><b>Factors Affecting DischargeRate:</b></p>
                <div class="sub-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Device Load: Power usage increases with device workload (e.g., gaming vs. idle).</li>
                        <li>Active Components: A bright screen, hard-working processor, or intensive network usage may increase the DischargeRate.</li>
                        <li>Battery Condition: Older batteries may exhibit a higher DischargeRate due to decreased efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Energy Saving Mode: Reduces DischargeRate by lowering device performance.</li>
                        <li>Ambient Temperature: Extreme temperatures (too hot/cold) may affect battery efficiency.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p><b>Example Values:</b> 1000 mW: The battery outputs 1000 milliwatts of power.</p>
