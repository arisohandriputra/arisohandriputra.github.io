        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>uBattery is a real-time battery monitoring tool designed to provide key insights into your device’s battery performance. It features a dynamic graph that displays battery levels from 0% to 100% and offers comprehensive information about your battery’s capacity, charge and discharge rates, full charge capacity, usage time, and overall status.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Display</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Graph:</strong> The graph displays the movement of the battery indicator up or down on the x and y axis. It also shows the current time to determine the time of battery decrease and increase.</li>
            <li><strong>Charge Rate:</strong> ChargeRate indicates the rate at which the battery receives electrical energy when charged. Usually measured in units of mW (milliwatt).</li>
            <li><strong>Discharge Rate:</strong> DischargeRate indicates the speed at which the battery releases energy for use by the device.</li>
            <li><strong>Voltage:</strong> Voltage is the nominal or standard voltage that the battery has been designed for by the manufacturer. This voltage reflects the value that the battery should produce when working under optimal conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemistry:</strong> Chemistry in battery data refers to the type of chemistry or composition of the materials used in the battery. Each type of battery chemistry has unique characteristics that affect the battery's capacity, voltage, lifespan, and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Shows the temperature value of your battery in Celsius.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Capacity is the maximum capacity designed for the battery by the manufacturer. This value indicates how much power (energy) the battery can store at its first full state after production.</li>
            <li><strong>Estimated Usage:</strong> Provides an estimate of the time in seconds that the device can last using the remaining battery power. This value is calculated based on the remaining battery capacity, the energy usage level of the device, and the state of the battery (for example, whether the battery is in the charging process or in the discharge state).</li>
            <li><strong>Serial Number:</strong> Serial Number is a unique code assigned by the manufacturer to each battery unit. It is the identifier used to distinguish one battery from another. Each battery produced by a particular manufacturer has a different serial number.</li>
            <li><strong>UniqueID:</strong> UniqueID is a more specific unique code used to identify a specific device or component, including batteries, in a system.</li>
            <li><strong>Power:</strong> Power indicates whether the battery power source is connected to A/C Power or not.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Displays battery condition information whether normal or otherwise.</li>
            <li><strong>Alert:</strong> “L” means early warning or Low, and “W” means warning for critical battery conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Remaining:</strong> Remaining time is the time that shows the movement of the battery indicator since the monitoring process was first started.</li>
            <li><strong>Full Charge Capacity:</strong> FullChargeCapacity refers to the full capacity of the battery when fully charged, usually measured in milliampere-hours (mAh) or watt-hours (Wh). This value indicates how much energy the battery can store when fully charged.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop:</strong> Stop Monitoring.</li>
            <li><strong>Save Report:</strong> Save Report Graph as Binary file.</li>
            <li><strong>Load Report:</strong> Load and view Binary report file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>The uBattery tool not only offers real-time monitoring but also allows users to export data for further analysis. The reports generated can be saved in binary format, making it easy to keep records or share data with other tools. The battery condition alert system provides timely warnings, ensuring that users can take action before the battery reaches a critical state.</p>
        <p>By using uBattery, users can make informed decisions about battery care, optimize charging cycles, and extend the lifespan of their device's battery. This tool is particularly useful for laptops, mobile devices, and other portable electronics that rely on rechargeable batteries.</p>
