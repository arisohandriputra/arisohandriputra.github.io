    <p><b>Ari Project</b> was founded in 2011 by Ari Sohandri Putra as a personal initiative to create practical and accessible software solutions for everyday computing needs. Initially starting as a small collection of personal tools developed to solve specific problems encountered in daily computer use, the project gradually expanded into a diverse range of utility applications designed for the Windows operating system.</p>

    <p>In its early years, Ari Project focused on building lightweight programs that required minimal system resources, ensuring they could run smoothly on both older and newer versions of Windows. This approach made the software highly accessible to a wide audience, especially in regions where high-end hardware was not always available.</p>

    <p>Over time, Ari Project’s portfolio grew to include tools for productivity, system optimization, file management, and various other practical utilities. What set Ari Project apart was its commitment to keeping most of its software free of charge, allowing anyone — from casual home users to IT professionals — to benefit without financial barriers.</p>

    <p>By maintaining a user-first philosophy, Ari Project continued to evolve with advancements in technology, ensuring compatibility from Windows 7 through Windows 11. Each application is designed with a balance of simplicity, reliability, and performance, reflecting the project’s mission to provide tools that “just work” without unnecessary complexity.</p>

    <p>Today, with over a decade of continuous development, Ari Project remains dedicated to empowering users through free, reliable, and intuitive software — staying true to its origins while adapting to the ever-changing digital landscape</p>
